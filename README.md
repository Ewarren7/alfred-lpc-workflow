Open Lastpass vault in Chrome
=======================
This workflow launches [Lastpass](www.lastpass.com) from alfred into a chrome browser. 

Then it uses apple script to press the keystroke of everything you typed after lpc which in turn searches lastpass. 

After installing workflow, activate alfred and then type lpc followed by a space an an optional search term.

**Note**

There are 2 workflows. You only need one, and I recommend `Open Lastpass Vault and pass search term.alfredworkflow`. It loads about 5 times faster using the less resource intensive vault found at chrome-extension://hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd/home.html. This vault also shows you a password in one click. 

The second, (Slower loading but richer vault), uses the full vault at chrome-extension://hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd/homelocal2.html and that takes about 5 seconds to load. Also once it loads it takes more user action to get to a password.
